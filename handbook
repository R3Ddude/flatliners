FLATLINERS (working title)

The setting: present day, present time. You don't seem to understand, but for all anyone cares, the optimism of the early 2000s is
further away than the turn of the next century. The constant rumble of the distant Maracaibo lightning is drowned out by the sounds of
the metropolis; once an isolated community, the __ Unified State is the product of South American, East Asian, and European ambitions.
Locals just call it Nexus City. Ostensibly, it's run by the République, and their military police, the Securétat. In truth, they and
everyone else are puppets of the mega-corporations that have made this place their testing ground. Let's face it, under the Securétat and
their masters, everyone in Nexus City — from the local gangs to the legal citizens — is guilty of something. But those who are especially
guilty are referred to as Flatliners... criminals with a slim life expectancy; criminals whose talents mean they never work for free.

...criminals like you.

ADJECTIVES
Adjectives are applied to a character or object any time their status changes significantly; this can happen naturally or can be
forced through the use of Actions; Adjectives have three states: Fleeting, Enduring, and Perpetual
	FLEETING Adjectives are applied for only a few turns at most and are removed on their own
	ENDURING Adjectives are applied for a longer period and require Action to remove
	PERPETUAL Adjectives are applied until the cause is completely replaced, overwritten, or destroyed
For gameplay and story purposes, there is no limit on which adjectives can or cannot be applied, but please try to stick to
Adjectives that don't explicitly connote a certain degree of severity (e.g. “wounded” instead of “bruised/broken” etc.)
Adjectives are influenced by Actions, Objects and Dice

Examples of Adjectives (feel free to use ones not on this list):
	Alert
	Broken
	Calm
	Confused
	Distracted
	Disarmed
	Damaged
	Fast
	Fatigued

	Glitched
	Hidden
	Intimidated
	Jammed
	Locked
	Resilient
	Shocked
	Wounded
		
ACTIONS
Actions are divided into broad categories and are used primarily in puzzle-solving and turns of Contention and Reaction instead of
role-play/acting; the rating defines the level of skill; each rating implicitly applies to a style of the respective action and must
be specified by the player
	Average rating			ordinary, never-been-trained-before citizens can do this
	Competent rating		self-taught hobbyists not trying to earn steady cash can do this
	Professional rating		experts with a profitable business to maintain can do this
	Master rating			only Gladwellian 野郎 (yarou) with too much fucking free time can do this

Core Action Categories
	Move: running, dodging, jumping, climbing, dancing, etc; if you're using a significant portion of your body, you're moving
	Compel: talking sweet, talking shit, and everything in between, but not limited to words...
	Hack: if there's a weakness in something, this is how you exploit it; one of the most valuable skills, limited only by your creativity and patience
	Fight: using all manner of bladed, blunt, brutal, and sometimes boring objects to beat the hydraulic fluid out of someone, though most people will stick to their fists
	Conceal: avoiding unwanted attention through overt or covert means, masters of this are usually hiding something else too
	Operate: the best and biggest things in life take a certain type of knowhow to use; if it can't be brute-forced or hacked, it usually needs to be operated (yes this includes firearms ya wee space slice)
	Observe: finding items, people, places, and generally interesting things, from the vague and abstract to the objectively solid
	Treat: relieving if not outright curing the various ailments of the flesh, mind, and their respective peripherals
